This is a sample Android mobile app that uses Firebase (https://firebase.google.com/) as the backend.

<b>This project is for educational / sharing purposes only. It is by no means a complete app.</b>

This project relies on such Firebase services as the Realtime Database, Storage, and Authentication. It also uses the ZXing (https://github.com/zxing/zxing) library which is adapted to its needs.
